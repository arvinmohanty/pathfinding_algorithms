Final Project

### Compile instructions
The main executable showcasing all of our algorithms can be built and run by executing `make && ./pathfind`.

Each algorithm also has its own test file which can be found under the `tests/` folder. Each test file can be compiled into its own executable. To compile them run these commands:
- `make shortestPathTest && ./shortestPathTest`
- `make landmarkPathTest && ./landmarkPathTest`
- `make undirectedGraphTest && ./undirectedGraphTest`
- `make sccTest && ./sccTest`
- `make dfsTest && ./dfsTest`

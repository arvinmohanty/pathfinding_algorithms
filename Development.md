Week 1 (11/25 due date)
  We have created the basic class structure and the public methods that our code/classes can call
  We have started to implement catch and will implement it by next week for testing
  We have created a basic Makefile to allow the code to compile
  We spent time looking over the datasets and deciding on the best Stanford dataset for the methods we call
  We have also started looking at some libraries that we could implement to make loading the graph and taking file contents easier
  Created a ghost iterator outline to fill out to allow for us to go through the data in an easier way
  This week was mainly spent outlining how and what methods to create to meet expectations and understanding the datasets

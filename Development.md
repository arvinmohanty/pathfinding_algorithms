Week 1 (11/25)
  We have created the basic class structure and the public methods that our code/classes can call.  We have started to implement catch and will implement it by next week for testing.  We have created a basic Makefile to allow the code to compile.  We spent time looking over the datasets and deciding on the best Stanford dataset for the methods we call.  We have also started looking at some libraries that we could implement to make loading the graph and taking file contents easier.  Created a ghost iterator outline to fill out to allow for us to go through the data in an easier way.  This week was mainly spent outlining how and what methods to create to meet expectations and understanding the datasets.
Week 2 (12/2)
This week we set up the test heirarchy in the Makefile, Github, and added catch.  We set up the contructor to properly build the graph.  We also focused on getting everyone behind the dataset and understanding how the graph adjacency list represntation works.  Through this, we were able to implement the shortest path algorithm and the landmark path.  Next week, we hope to have the project done by 12/9 for our meeting about the video.  Next week the final algorithm will be finished and testing will be as well.
